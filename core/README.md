## Serialization

The standard way to serialize LionWeb _Chunks_ is by using JSON.

In addition to this format, there is the need to use more efficient formats to complete operations on very large amounts of nodes in a sustainable amount of time. For this reason also [Protocol Buffers](https://protobuf.dev/) and [FlatBuffers](https://flatbuffers.dev/) are supported.

They are both formats created by Google, and supported in many programming languages.

Protocol Buffers has wider support. For example, there is a gradle plugin that we use to generate the code from the format definition.

In the case of Flat Buffers there are only unmaintained gradle plugins, therefore we need to install the `flatc` program and running it locally. For this reason the generated files are stored in git, among the manually written code.

The code can be regenerated by running this command from the root of the project:
```
flatc --java -o core/src/main/java core/src/main/flatbuffers/chunk.fbs
```
